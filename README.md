# Surfs Up
## Overview
The purpose of the included analysis is to explore weather trends (temperature) that would contribute to the success of a surf shop/ice cream stand business. Warm, pleasant weather would contribute to more customers frequenting the business, so temperature is an important factor for sustainability. To consider opposite months, the included analysis provides detailed temperature trends for the month of June and the month of December. The analysis includes data from 2010-2017.

## Results
- June is typically a warmer month for Hawai'i, the difference in temperature is around 4 degrees. The mean temperature in June is 74.9, while December is 71. 
- While December may have some outlying low temperatures (such as 56), those would be rare given that 25th percentile is consistent with a 4 degree difference (June 25th percentile = 73, while December's 25th percentile = 69). One might argue those few outliers are not enough to deter the overall success of a business.
- The 50th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum temperatures differ only 2-4 degrees between June and December, indicating the temperature variation year-round is less than 5 degrees overall.

## Summary
Given the strong sample size (7 years, 1700 measurements for June tempeartures, 1517 measurements for December temperatures), this analysis supports the argument that a year-round business that relies on pleasant weather would find consistent tempeartures even at opposite times of year.
For additional analysis, the same comparison between June and December was completed based on precipitation. Rain could cause less customers to pursue a day of surfing or ice cream, so it would be helpful to determine if this could be more of a factor. Based on the analysis, June and December experience small amounts of rainfall with less than 0.1" difference between the months' average rainfall. June averages 0.14" rainfall while December averages 0.22" rainfall. Both months may experience some heavy rainfall given they each have high max measurements (June max 4.43, December max 6.42), however those would be considered rare outliers given the 75th percentile for each month is 0.12" (June) and 0.15" (December). So similar to tempearture, those few outlier days should not be enough to deter the overall success of a business.
